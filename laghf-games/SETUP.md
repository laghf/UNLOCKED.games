## Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# If you have PowerShell execution policy issues, run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Then install dependencies:
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
The site will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a `public_html` folder with all the static files.

3. Go to Settings > Pages
